# Thunder
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.github.jaeyunn15/thunder/badge.svg?style=plastic)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.jaeyunn15/thunder)

A WebSocket library that draws heavily from the [Scarlet](https://github.com/Tinder/Scarlet) by Tinder.     
Currently, support only for Coroutine Flow.     

---
## Production Story
- [Thunder: WebSocket have come through the clouds.](https://medium.com/proandroiddev/%EF%B8%8Fthunder-websocket-have-come-through-the-clouds-4db1a9b31ffa)

---
## Example project usage.
- [CryptoApp](https://github.com/jaeyunn15/CryptoApp) : You can see Thunder embedded in a real-time data architecture.

---
## Basic Feature
- WebSocket connection using OkHttp3.
- Regardless of the state of your app, if it's alive, it will automatically manage to stay connected. 
- Provide **retry and reconnect** handling based on the application's network and socket state.
- Provide the ability to **automatically recover requests** via the last request cache.
- Provides a websocket connection based on the STOMP. (December, 2023)

### Converter 
- Gson
- KotlinX-Serialization **(Default)**

## Download First
Thunder is available via Maven Central.

First, go to your settings.gradle file and add the code below.
~~~ groovy
[settings.gradle]

dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral() <-- here! you have to copy & paste
    }
}
~~~

Use the library by adding a Dependency to the module you want to use.

## Usage

First, we need to define an interface to request data and receive responses.
~~~ kotlin
interface SocketService {

    @Send
    fun request(request: BinanceRequest)

    @Receive
    fun response(): Flow<TickerResponse>
}
~~~


Second, we need to create a Thunder instance, which requires an ApplicationContext and an OkHttpClient.
~~~ kotlin

val thunderInstance = Thunder.Builder()
    .webSocketCore(okHttpClient.makeWebSocketCore("wss://fstream.binance.com/stream"))
    .setApplicationContext(context)
    .setConverterType(ConverterType.Gson)
    .build()

thunderInstance.create<SocketService>()
~~~



Alternatively, you can use a dependency injection library like Hilt to create them for you.

~~~ kotlin

    @Singleton
    @Provides
    fun provideOkHttpClient(): OkHttpClient {
        val httpLoggingInterceptor = HttpLoggingInterceptor()
            .setLevel(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY)
        return OkHttpClient.Builder()
            .addInterceptor(httpLoggingInterceptor)
            .pingInterval(
                10,
                TimeUnit.SECONDS
            ) // If there are no events for a minute, we need to put in some code for ping pong to output a socket connection error from okhttp.
            .build()
    }

    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideSocketService(
        okHttpClient: OkHttpClient,
        @ApplicationContext context: Context
    ): SocketService {
        return Thunder.Builder()
            .webSocketCore(okHttpClient.makeWebSocketCore("wss://fstream.binance.com/stream"))
            .setApplicationContext(context)
            .setConverterType(ConverterType.Gson)
            .build()
            .create()
    }

    // or you can like this. (Kotlin Type-Safe Builder)
    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideSocketService(
        okHttpClient: OkHttpClient,
        @ApplicationContext context: Context
    ): SocketService {
        return thunder {
            webSocketCore(okHttpClient.makeWebSocketCore("wss://fstream.binance.com/stream"))
            setApplicationContext(context)
            setConverterType(ConverterType.Serialization)
        }.create()
    }
~~~



You can request data based on the request format, and receive data using Flow, depending on the response format.
A single request/response example used in the AAC viewmodel.

~~~ kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MainViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val service: SocketService
): ViewModel() {

    private val _response = MutableStateFlow<Ticker?>(null)
    val response: StateFlow<Ticker?> = _response.asStateFlow()

    fun request() {
        viewModelScope.launch {            
            service.request(request = BinanceRequest())
        }
    }

    fun observeResponse() {
        service.observeTicker().onEach { result ->
            _response.update { result.data }
        }.launchIn(viewModelScope)
    }
}
~~~
