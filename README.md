# Thunder

A WebSocket library that draws heavily from the [Scarlet](https://github.com/Tinder/Scarlet) by Tinder.     
The overall design of this library is very similar to Scarlet.     
Currently, support only for Coroutine Flow.

## Download First

First, go to your settings.gradle file and add the code below.
~~~ groovy
[settings.gradle]

dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // <-- here! you have to copy & paste
    }
}
~~~

Use the library by adding a Dependency to the module you want to use.

~~~ groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.jaeyunn15:Thunder:0.0.2'
}
~~~

---
## Restriction ðŸš¨
We need to target **Java 17** because the library is aligned with **Java 17**.      
In the future, we will respond by lowering the Java version.

## Usage

First, we need to define an interface to request data and receive responses.
~~~ kotlin
interface SocketService {

    @Send
    fun request(request: BinanceRequest)

    @Receive
    fun response(): Flow<TickerResponse>
}
~~~


Second, we need to create a Thunder instance, which requires an ApplicationContext and an OkHttpClient.
~~~ kotlin

val thunderInstance = Thunder.Builder()
    .webSocketCore(okHttpClient.makeWebSocketCore("wss://fstream.binance.com/stream"))
    .setApplicationContext(context)
    .build()

thunderInstance.create<SocketService>()
~~~



Alternatively, you can use a dependency injection library like Hilt to create them for you.

~~~ kotlin

    @Singleton
    @Provides
    fun provideOkHttpClient(): OkHttpClient {
        val httpLoggingInterceptor = HttpLoggingInterceptor()
            .setLevel(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY)
        return OkHttpClient.Builder()
            .addInterceptor(httpLoggingInterceptor)
            .build()
    }

    @Provides
    @Singleton
    fun provideSocketService(
        okHttpClient: OkHttpClient,
        @ApplicationContext context: Context
    ): SocketService {
        return Thunder.Builder()
            .webSocketCore(okHttpClient.makeWebSocketCore("wss://fstream.binance.com/stream"))
            .setApplicationContext(context)
            .build()
            .create()
    }
~~~



You can request data based on the request format, and receive data using Flow, depending on the response format.
A single request/response example used in the AAC viewmodel.

~~~ kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MainViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val service: SocketService
): ViewModel() {

    private val _response = MutableStateFlow<Ticker?>(null)
    val response: StateFlow<Ticker?> = _response.asStateFlow()

    fun request() {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            delay(2000) // TODO :: automatically request process base on connection. maybe resolve at 0.0.3
            service.request(request = BinanceRequest())
        }
    }

    fun observeResponse() {
        service.observeTicker().onEach { result ->
            _response.update { result.data }
        }.launchIn(viewModelScope)
    }
}
~~~
